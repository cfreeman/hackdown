HackDown
========

HackDown is a series of maker challenges, designed to engage the general community at hackerspaces, schools and other places where people can build awesome things.

Each challenge is designed to run over the course of a month, were teams of four or five come together one evening a week for two or three hours to build a solution to the challenge. At the end of the month, each teams creations are pitted against one another in an eclectic evening of maker cacophony. 

The only rule of HackDown, is that teams are only permitted to use the materials provided in a box at the start of the month (each team gets exactly the same materials).
