## Challenge 3 - Traverse the wire

OK, so the first two challenges? Warm-ups. Are you ready for the main event? Ricky Bobby thinks he's on fire, and needs to be rescued from the other side of the canyon. Build a contraption (gondola, chair lift, etc) that will crawl along a wire from one side of the canyon to the other, pick up a matchbox car and return it safely back to the other side. Only materials from from your box can be added to your matchbox car rescuer (including glues and fixings), but you can use any tool to shape and alter those materials. 

### Environment.

Two plinths (or tables) of the same height are separated by 600mm. Suspend a single stretch of string 150mm above the table tops, spanning the gap between the two tables. Place a matchbox car (perhaps with a hook or loop attached to the top to make it easier to lift) on one of the tables, directly beneath the spanning string. People will attach their rescuer onto the string above the other table and it will drive from one side of the canyon to the other. Pick up the matchbox car and return back again.

### Judging

Judging is always hard, but here is a simple points based system to help get things started (feel free to tweak and change this as necessary): 

* Loudest rescuer. Award 5 points to the team whose gondola is the loudest, 4 for the next, etc.
* Fastest rescuer. Award 5 points to the team whose gondola successfully travels from one side of the canyon to the other, 4 for the next, etc. 
* Most number of moving parts, award 5 points to the team with the most number of parts in their rescuer, 4 for the next, etc.
* Successfully picking up the car award 5 bonus points.
* Successfully returning the car to the other side award another 5 bonus points.

The team with the highest number of points is the winner*.

\* This really should be more of a 'everyone is a winner' kinda deal - everyone should get a bit of a laugh and giggle.
