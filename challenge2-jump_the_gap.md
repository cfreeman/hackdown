## Challenge 2 - Jump the gap.

Now that some oaf has destroyed the bridge spanning the canyon, Ricky Bobby needs to get back to the other side, so that he can "send in his application to the real world". Build Ricky Bobby a contraption that will fling his matchbox car from one side to the other. You can't directly throw the car, your flinger must store energy and launch the matchbox car (i.e. catapults, slingshots, etc) from one side of the canyon to the other. Only materials from your box can be added to your matchbox car flinger (including glues and fixings), but you can use any tool to shape and alter those materials.

### Environment

Two plinths (or tables) of the same height are separated by 600mm. On one of the tables or plinths, create a small cardboard fence 100x100x20mm, as a landing area for Ricky. The other side will be where people place their car flingers.

### Box Contents

* 2pcs metal wire coat hanger
* 4pcs Rubber bands (size 34)
* 2pcs empty cotton spools
* 1pc 3mm x 100mm x 225mm balsa wood sheet
* 1pc 12mm x 12mm x 450mm balsa wood sticks
* 2pcs of 1.5mm x 75mm x 450mm balsa wood sheet
* 1pc of 5.0mm x 75mm x 225mm balsa wood board
* 1 125ml tube of PVA glue
* 5 metres of string

Estimated kit cost (per team): ~$11.00 (excluding shipping costs)

### Judging

Judging is always hard, but here is a simple points based system to help get things started (feel free to tweak and change this as necessary): 

* Furthest fling. Award 5 points for the team that is able to fling a matchbox car the furthest (just along the ground), 4 for the next, etc.
* Most number of moving parts, award 5 points to the team with the most number of moving parts, 4 for the next, etc.
* With the flinger setup on one side of the canyon give them team three attempts to fling and land their car on the other side. Landing, but bouncing out of the landing area award 2 points. Landing, and staying within the landing area, award 5 points.

The team with the highest number of points is the winner*.

\* This really should be more of a 'everyone is a winner' kinda deal - everyone should get a bit of a laugh and giggle.
