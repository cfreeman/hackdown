## Challenge #1 - Build a bridge. 

Ricky Bobby likes to drive *fast*, and wants to drive from one side of a canyon to the other. Build Ricky Bobby a bridge that spans a 600mm canyon. The bridge must be wide and flat enough that a matchbox car can roll freely from one end to the other. Only materials from your box can be added to your bridge (including glues and fixings), but you can use any tool to shape and alter those materials.

### Environment.

Two plinths (or tables) of the same height are separated by 600mm. You will also need a matchbox car or two to roll across the bridges.

### Box Contents

* 2pcs of 3mm x 100mm x 450mm balsa wood sheet.
* 4pcs of 12mm x 12mm x 450mm balsa wood sticks.
* 10pcs of 1.5mm x 75mm x 450mm balsa wood sheet.
* 2pcs of 5.0mm x 75mm x 450mm balsa wood board.
* 1 125ml tube of PVA glue.
* 5 metres of string.

Estimated kit cost (per team): ~$17.00 (excluding shipping costs)

### Judging

Judging is always hard, but here is a simple points based system to help get things started (feel free to tweak and change this as necessary): 

* Test to make sure a matchbox car is able to freely roll from side of the bridge to another. Subtract 5 points if the car can't make it across.
*  Lightest bridge, weigh the bridge on a set of kitchen scales and award 5 points for the lightest bridge, 4 for the next, etc. 
* Best looking bridge. Award 5 points for the best looking bridge, 4 for the next, etc.
* Strongest bridge. Using string, suspend a bucket from the centre of the bridge (300mm from the table). Slowly fill the bucket with water until the bridge buckles and breaks. Weigh the bucket of water afterwards. Award the bridge that held the heaviest amount of water 5 points, 4 for the next, etc.

The team with the highest number of points is the winner*. 

Stay tuned for the next challenge, which will build upon skills developed in this challenge and add some mechanical madness into the mix. 

\* This really should be more of a 'everyone is a winner' kinda deal - everyone should get a bit of a laugh and giggle.
