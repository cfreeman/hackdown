            HackDown is a free series of maker challenges, designed to engage the general community at Hackerspaces, FabLabs, schools and other places where people come together to build awesome things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each challenge is designed to run over the course of a month, where teams of about five are given a box of materials and come together one evening a week for three hours to build a solution to the challenge. At the end of the month, each of the creations are pitted against another in an eclectic evening of maker cacophony.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only rule of HackDown, is that teams are only permitted to use the materials provided in a box at the start of the month (each team gets exactly the same materials).
          </p>

            HackDown is 'open source' and completely free for anyone to download and run in their Hackspace, FabLab or school. Just purchase your
            own materials (feel free to tweak and change things depending on materials you can source locally), invite people along and build
            cool things!
